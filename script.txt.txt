Git guide
By Aoife Leahy

Git add .:
This command adds new files that will go to your directory. You should use the command git add .
You need to make sure that you spell it right and also add the period at the end in order for this command to work.
When using this command it will add files except for the ones that are matching from .gitignore.
You can also alternatively use the command git add filename/pattern.
When using this command, it only adds files to the next commit only.
If you modify the file after adding it but before actually committing, you should then add it again. This will ignore the first modified version.

Reset:
To reset you need to use the command git reset-filename.
This reset command removes a file from the staging area.
You can commit without it meaning that you can do much more with it and add to it.
